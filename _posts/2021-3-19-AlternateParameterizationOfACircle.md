title: Alternate Parameterization of a Circle
---

The first quadrant of the unit circle is defined by the parametric functions
$$
\begin{align*}
x(t)&=\cos{u}\\
y(t)&=\sin{u}\quad 0\leq u\leq\frac{\pi}{2}.
\end{align*}
$$

The following image illustrates this parameterization.  Note that as $u$ increases from $0$ to $1$, the point $(x(u), y(u))=(\cos{u}, \sin{u})$ travels along the first quadrant of the unit circle.

We will show that by setting $t=\tan(u/2)$, one can derive the alternate representation
$$
\begin{align*}
x(t)&=\frac{1-t^2}{1+t^2}\\
y(t)&=\frac{2t}{1+t^2}\quad 0\leq t\leq 1.
\end{align*}
$$
